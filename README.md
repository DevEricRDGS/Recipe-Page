## My process

I started by developing the HTML structure using semantic tags, adding classes to some elements for future styling. Then, I styled the page with CSS and finally made it responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Layout Responsive

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned and better understood how the Flexbox display works.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about Flexbox, semantic HTML tags, CSS styling, and how to better approach responsive design.
